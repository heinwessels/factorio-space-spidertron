A flying spidertron capable of traversing in the zero-gravity environment of space. These spidertrons have the same properties as normal spidertrons except it hovers using a rocket engine, and has no guns. Therefore they are perfect builders for your space bases where there might not be scaffolding everywhere to walk. Now you have a friend you can leave behind in the remote astroid field that will happily help you fix your inevitable mistakes.

**Recommendation:** The mod [Spidertron Dock](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/spidertron-dock)'s functionality was originally part of this mod. I think Spidertron Docks are quite fun, especially the fact that you can place docile spidertons on your ships without a integrity penalty. Almost like a R2D2 droid that you can activate whenever something goes wrong during interplanetary travel.
