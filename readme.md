A flying spidertron capable of traversing in the zero-gravity environment of space. These spidertrons have the same properties as normal spidertrons except it hovers using a rocket engine, and has no guns (yet). Therefore they are perfect builders for your space bases where there might not be scaffolding everywhere to walk. Now you have a friend you can leave behind in the remote astroid field that will happily help you fix your inevitable mistakes.

Also included is a spidertron dock for safe travel on spaceships. It's designed to be used with [Space Exploration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration)'s spaceships. This serves two functions:
- Spidertrons will no longer count towards hull stress because they are safetly docked, and therefore need less space and structure to store them securely.
- Spiders losing limbs when forgetting to *"Keep your *~~hands and~~* legs inside the vehicle"*.The docks will keep them safe during your exploration to new stars to conquer and expand. It does mean also that regular spidertrons can no longer function in space or on spaceships - which be disabled with a settings if required.
